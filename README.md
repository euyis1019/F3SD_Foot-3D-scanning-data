# Foot 3D Scanning Dataset - F3SD


### Overview:
This dataset contains basic human body data obtained through foot scans and personal measurements. Each record corresponds to specific foot dimensions and basic biological characteristics of an individual. The dataset is designed to support research in areas such as biomechanics, footwear design, and personalized customization.

### Data Source:
The data is collected through foot scanning devices and personal information collection. Each record includes fields related to the scanning date, time, and basic biological features (e.g., gender, height, weight).

### Data Fields Description:
- **Scan ID**: A unique identifier for each scan.
- **Scan Date**: The date the scan was conducted.
- **Scan Time**: The time the scan was conducted.
- **Customer Name**: The name of the customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Height (cm)**: The height of the customer in centimeters.
- **Weight (kg)**: The weight of the customer in kilograms.
- **Foot Length (Left/Right)**: The length of the customer's left and right feet (in millimeters).
- **Sole Length (Left/Right)**: The sole length of the customer's left and right feet (in millimeters).

### Use Cases:
This dataset can be applied in the following research and application fields:
1. Personalized foot shape analysis in footwear design.
2. Foot feature studies in sports biomechanics.
3. Customized insole design through additive manufacturing.
4. Ergonomic studies on the relationship between foot shape and comfort.

### Data Format:
The dataset is provided in a standard table format (e.g., Excel file), making it suitable for direct integration with data analysis software.

### License:
The dataset will be released under an open license, allowing academic research and non-commercial use. Please cite the dataset source when using it.
